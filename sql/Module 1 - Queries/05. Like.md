05. LIKE

# LIKE
The LIKE operator can be used to search for a pattern in a column. Itâ€™s used in the WHERE clause:

    SELECT * 
    FROM shows 
    WHERE name LIKE 'T%'; 

The percentage sign % is a wildcard character that can be used with LIKE. You can use it to match characters to a pattern of your desired query.

This statement filters the result to only include shows with names that begin with the letter 'T'.

The % can be used in different ways:

A% matches values that begin with letter 'A'.
%z matches values that end with 'z'.

We can also use % both before and after a pattern:

    SELECT * 
    FROM shows 
    WHERE name LIKE '%the%'; 

Here, any show that contains the word "the" in its name will be returned.

Instructions

Solution:

        FROM shows
