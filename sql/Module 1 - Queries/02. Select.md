**02. SELECT**

# The Asterisk *
The SELECT statement we ran is core to SQL:

SELECT * FROM shows;

Here, we broke the statement into two lines; it still does the same thing:

SELECT *
FROM shows;

SELECT retrieves data from a database.

* asterisk means all columns.

FROM keyword followed by the table name.

shows is the name of the table we are requesting data from.

; we end the statement with a semicolon.

Simply put, we are selecting all the columns from the shows table.


# Specific Columns
The * grabs all the columns in a table, but what if we want to select just a few of the columns?

If we only want to select specific columns, we can list out the column names, separated by commas:

SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table_name;

Here’s an example:

SELECT id, name, genre
FROM shows;

We only select the id, name, and genre columns from the shows table.

Note: SQL keywords like SELECT and FROM are not case-sensitive, but it's common to write them in uppercase to distinguish them from column names (id, name, genre) and table names (shows), which are written in lowercase.

Let’s try it out.

Instructions
Select all the columns from the shows table.

Now, select just the name and genre columns of the shows table.
