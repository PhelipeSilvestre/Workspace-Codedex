# WHERE

Now what if we wanted to filter information based on a condition? We can use the WHERE clause.

We can use the WHERE clause to filter for information based on a condition:

    SELECT *
    FROM shows
    WHERE id = 23;

    id = 23 is the condition. Only shows with an id equal to 23 will be returned.

Here’s another example:

    SELECT *
    FROM shows
    WHERE year > 2020;

    year > 2020 is the condition. Only the shows that were released later than 2020 will be returned.

Note: The WHERE keyword always goes after the FROM part of the query.

# Comparison Operators

Here are all the SQL comparison operators that we can use in a condition:

    = equal to
    != not equal to
    > greater than
    < less than
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to

We use them to compare two values in the WHERE clause.

Let’s try them out.
