08. NYC Restaurants
# Congrats!
Hooray! You got to the end of the first chapter! ðŸŽˆ

Hereâ€™s a recap:

SELECT selects data FROM a database. (* selects all the columns)
DISTINCT returns unique values in a column.
WHERE filters results based on a condition.
Comparison operators: =, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators.
ORDER BY sorts the data in ascending/descending order.
Letâ€™s put it together with something fun.

Instructions
The CodÃ©dex team is based in NYC and we put together our top 50 restaurants in the city. ðŸ˜‹



Itâ€™s in a new restaurants dataset that you can access with:

SELECT *
FROM restaurants;

It has the following columns:

id
name
cuisine
borough
neighborhood
price
yelp_review
Play around with the table and find out the following:

What are all the unique cuisines in the table?

Solution:

    SELECT DISTINCT cuisine
    FROM restaurants;


What are all the Chinese restaurants? Italian?
What are all the spots in Greenpoint (a neighborhood in Brooklyn)?
