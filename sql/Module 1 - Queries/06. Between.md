# BETWEEN

The BETWEEN operator is used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. The range can be between two numbers, texts, or even dates, separated by an AND keyword.

For example, this query filters the result to only include shows between the years 2020 and 2025 (inclusive):

    SELECT *
    FROM shows
    WHERE year
    BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025;

When the values are text, BETWEEN filters the result within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, BETWEEN filters the result to only include shows with names that begin with the letter 'A' up to 'D':

    SELECT *
    FROM shows
    WHERE name
    BETWEEN 'A' AND 'D';

Note: BETWEEN stops at the second letter, but doesn’t include values that begin with the second letter.

So if a show’s title is just 'D', it would be returned, whereas 'Dragon Ball Super' will not.
