# Unique Values
When analyzing a database, we may want to view just the unique values within a column (with no duplicates).

DISTINCT is used to return just the unique values in a column.

Here's how we select all the genres from shows:

SELECT genre
FROM shows;

We'd get 50 rows of genres for each TV show with a bunch of duplicates.

If we add a DISTINCT keyword after SELECT:

SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM shows;

Only the unique genres in the shows table will be returned.

Instructions
The term "Streaming Wars" was coined to describe the era of competition between video streaming services such as Netflix, HBO, Disney+, etc. ⚔️

We have a stream column in the shows table for that info.

Use DISTINCT to select the unique streaming services in the shows table.
