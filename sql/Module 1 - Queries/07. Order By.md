07. ORDER BY

# ORDER BY

We've learned a lot about how to filter data up until this point. Now, let's learn how to sort them

The ORDER BY statement sorts rows of data in ascending or descending order. By default, this command sorts the data in ascending order.

So how does it work? Let’s see it in action:

    SELECT name, genre, stream, year
    FROM shows
    ORDER BY year;

This results into selecting 4 columns from our table but if you look closely, the year column is sorted into ascending order.

It will look something like:

    |name	            |genre	|stream	      |year
    |Sex and the City	|Drama	|HBO	      |1998
    |The Sopranos	    |Crime  |HBO	      |1999
    |One Piece	        |Anime	|Crunchyroll  |1999
    |Bleach	            |Anime	|Crunchyroll  |2004

Let’s say we want to get all the latest shows this time, we will have to sort the year column into descending order using the DESC command:

    SELECT name, genre, stream, year
    FROM shows
    ORDER BY year DESC;

It will look something like:

    |name	          |genre	        |stream	    |year
    |The Last of Us   |Thriller Drama	|HBO	    |2023
    |Tokyo Vice	      |Crime Drama	    |HBO	    |2022
    |Wednesday	      |Black Comedy	    |Netflix	|2022
    |The Bear	      |Drama	        |Hulu	    |2022
    |Band of Brothers |War Drama	    |HBO	    |2022

Let’s test what we learned in this exercise so far.
