# SUM()

What happens when you find the total of numbers?

The SUM() aggregate function takes a column and returns the total sum of the values in it.

    SELECT SUM(plays)
    FROM playlist;

Here, we are finding the total listens of the whole playlist. Which should be 40,548,956,220 seconds!

Instructions

How long is this playlist? Use SUM() to find the total duration.

Solution:

    SELECT SUM(duration)
    FROM playlist;
