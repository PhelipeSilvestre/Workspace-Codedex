# Congrats!

Hooray! You've made it to the end of the second chapter! ðŸŽˆ

Hereâ€™s a recap:

    COUNT() returns the number of rows.
    MIN() returns the smallest value in a column.
    MAX() returns the largest value in a column.
    SUM() returns the total sum in a column.
    AVG() returns the average value in a column.
    GROUP BY groups the result using the common values in a column.

Letâ€™s put it together with something fun.

Instructions

CodÃ©dex is a team of gamers and we put together our top 40 games of all-time. ðŸŽ®

Itâ€™s in a new games table that you can play around with:

    SELECT *
    FROM games;

It has the following columns:

    id
    title
    genre
    studio
    headquarters
    language
    year
    metascore
    players

You can formulate your own questions, but here are some of ours:

What is the most popular game in the list?
What are the counts of all the programming languages?
What are the average Metascores for each of the genres?
Once you are done, post a screenshot of your findings on Twitter by clicking the icon below, and then head over to #CodedexVideoGames and review another learner's work. Be supportive of your fellow learners! :)
