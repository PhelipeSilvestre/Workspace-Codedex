10. Counting Rows

# COUNT()

The first aggregate function we will learn is the COUNT() function! It's exactly how it sounds!

The COUNT() function counts the number of rows:

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM table_name;

This returns the total number of rows within a table.

Notice how the COUNT(_) has the asterisk _ within the parentheses, this is because we are counting every row.

But wait... that's it? All it does is count the total number of rows?

Not quite, we are are going to learn to basics of the aggregate functions first. When we combine them with something called GROUP BY later in this chapter, then they become 10x more powerful! ðŸ”¥

Letâ€™s try it out.

Instructions

Find the total number of rows in the playlist table with COUNT().

Solution:

    To count the number of rows in a table in SQL, you can use the COUNT() function. Hereâ€™s a basic example using a table named playlist:

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
        FROM playlist;

    This query will return a single row with a column named total_rows that contains the total number of rows in the playlist table.

    If you want to count rows based on specific conditions, you can add a WHERE clause. For example, to count the number of rows for a specific artist, you can do something like this:

        SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
        FROM playlist
        WHERE artist = 'Artist Name';

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of the query:

    SELECT COUNT(*): The COUNT(*) function counts all rows in the result set.

    AS total_rows: This gives a name to the column in the result, so the output will be more readable.

    FROM playlist: This specifies the table from which to count the rows.

    WHERE artist = 'Artist Name': This optional clause filters the rows to count only those that meet the specified condition (in this case, rows where the artist column matches 'Artist Name').

If you need to count the number of rows for each artist separately, you can use the GROUP BY clause:

    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS total_rows
    FROM playlist
    GROUP BY artist;

This query will return a list of artists and the number of rows for each one.
