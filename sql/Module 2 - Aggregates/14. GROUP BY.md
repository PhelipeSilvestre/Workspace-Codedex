# GROUP BY

Now, knowing aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG(), it’s time to bring GROUP BY into the fold. This is one of the most useful tools in SQL.

The GROUP BY statement groups rows of data with the same values into buckets. It’s often used with aggregate functions to group the result by one or more columns.

So what the heck does that mean? Let’s show it because it’s easier that way:

    SELECT genre, COUNT(*) 
    FROM playlist 
    GROUP BY genre;

What this does is we are grouping together all the different genres and displaying two columns: the genre and the count of that genre.

It will look something like:

    |genre	    |COUNT(*)
    |Indie Rock	|4
    |R&B	    |3
    |K-Pop	    |1

Let’s try another one.

Suppose we want to see the average song lengths for each genre, we can do:

    SELECT genre, AVG(duration)
    FROM playlist 
    GROUP BY genre;

What this does is we are grouping together all the different genres and displaying two columns: the genre and the average of the song length for that genre.

It will look something like:

    |genre	    |AVG(duration)
    |Indie Rock	|228.75
    |R&B	    |224.66
    |K-Pop	    |213

Let’s test it out.

Instructions

Using GROUP BY, find all the different artists and their average number of plays in two columns.

Solution:

    SELECT artist, AVG(plays)
    FROM playlist
    GROUP BY artist;
