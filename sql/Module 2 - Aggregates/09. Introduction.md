# Introduction

Welcome back to another episode of SQL! ðŸ™Œ

SQL databases are notorious for having a ton of numbers in them! In this chapter, weâ€™ll learn to use aggregates to analyze them.

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations, especially numbers.

The most common aggregate functions are:

    COUNT(): returns the number of rows.
    MAX(): returns the largest value in a column.
    MIN(): returns the smallest value in a column.
    SUM(): returns the total sum in a column.
    AVG(): returns the average value in a column.

Aggregate functions are used a ton with something called a GROUP BY which we will also learn later in this chapter.

Without further ado, letâ€™s get familiar with the playlist table weâ€™ll be using! ðŸ’¿

Instructions

In the code editor, run the following:

    SELECT *
    FROM playlist;

It has the following columns:

title
artist
album
year
genre
plays (total number of streams)
duration (song length in seconds)

We will use this table throughout the chapter.

Are there any songs you recognize?
