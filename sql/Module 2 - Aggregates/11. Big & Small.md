# Big & Small

Letâ€™s learn about two more aggregate functions!

MIN() and MAX() are exactly how they sound: they return the minimum and maximum value in a column, respectively.

For example, this returns the smallest value in the plays column:

    SELECT MIN(plays)
    FROM playlist;

Which is 1,000... *cue sad music.

This finds the most popular song in the table:

    SELECT title, artist, MAX(plays)
    FROM playlist;

Notice how we are returning three columns here! So we know exactly whose song got the most plays ("Redbone" by Childish Gambino with 1,591,972,548). Over a billion! ðŸ˜®


Instructions

What is the oldest song in the playlist? What about the newest song?

Use MIN() and MAX() to find out!

Solution:

MIN()
    SELECT title, artist, MIN(year)
    FROM playlist;

        |title	        |artist	        |MIN(year)
        |God Only Knows	|The Beach Boys	|1966    

MAX()
    SELECT title, artist, MAX(year)
    FROM playlist;
        |title	            |artist	        |MAX(year)
        |Beautiful Things	|Benson Boone	|2024
